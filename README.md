# Run_Length_Encoding
Given string using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). The goal is to replace consecutive identical characters with the character followed by the number of its occurrences. For example, "AAAAABBBCDDDDD" should be encoded as "5A3B1C5D". The task is to implement an efficient algorithm that performs this compression.
